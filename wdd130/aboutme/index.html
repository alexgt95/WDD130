    <p>I am looking forward to get a Software Engineering Degree. I love running, yoga, weight lifting, and playing a few videogames.</p>
    <p>I am single and have no children. I currently sell things over the phone and to be honest I cannot wait to get a developer job, I am more of an introvert than an extrovert.</p>
    <p>I love BYU Idaho's people! We have a very kind, smart, and nice atmosphere. </p>
    <p>I have seen many jobs in the webdevelopment area and I can also use this skill to start businesses!</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was born. My favorite quote is from President Nelson: "Anger never persuades. Hostility builds no one. Contention never leads to inspired solutions...You have your agency to choose contention or reconciliation. I urge you to choose to be a peacemaker, now and always." and my favorite scripture would be: D&C 128:8 8 Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the apower of the priesthood, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you bbind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be recorded in heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be judged, according to their own works, whether they themselves have attended to the cordinances in their own propria persona, or by the means of their own agents, according to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation from before the foundation of the world, according to the records which they have kept concerning their dead.</p>
    <p>Just realized all my sentences start with I. I am excited to work and get to know you guys!</p>
